# What is the running time of Radix Sort?
Let there be d digits in input integers. Radix Sort takes O(d*(n+b)) time where b is the base for representing numbers, 
for example, for decimal system, b is 10. What is the value of d? If k is the maximum possible value, 
then d would be O(logb(k)). So overall time complexity is O((n+b) * logb(k)). Which looks more than the time complexity
of comparison based sorting algorithms for a large k. Let us first limit k. Let k <= nc where c is a constant. 
In that case, the complexity becomes O(nLogb(n)). But it still doesnâ€™t beat comparison based sorting algorithms.
What if we make value of b larger?. What should be the value of b to make the time complexity linear? 
If we set b as n, we get the time complexity as O(n). In other words, we can sort an array of integers 
with range from 1 to nc if the numbers are represented in base n (or every digit takes log2(n) bits).

# Is Radix Sort preferable to Comparison based sorting algorithms like Quick-Sort?

If we have log2n bits for every digit, the running time of Radix appears to be better than Quick Sort for 
a wide range of input numbers. The constant factors hidden in asymptotic notation are higher for Radix Sort and Quick-Sort 
uses hardware caches more effectively. 
Also, Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine and counting sort takes extra space to sort numbers.
